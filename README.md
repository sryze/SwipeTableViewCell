SwipeTableViewCell
==================

This is a (pretty minimalistic) subclass ot `UITableViewCell` that lets you 
define custom row actions that are triggered using left and right swipe 
gestures. Unlike the built-in `UITableView` row actions it allows you to also 
add left hand side actions. 

Actions use images for their content. Support for custom views will be added 
in future versions.
